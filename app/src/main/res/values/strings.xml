    <string name="tips">Keep Fat to a Minimum</string>
    <string name="tip_article">Adult diets should be low in fat, especially saturated fat.Saturated fat, which is the main fat in animal products,
        fried foods, chocolate, cakes and biscuits, is more easily deposited as fat tissue than unsaturated fat. Saturated fat can also be converted
        into cholesterol and cause blood cholesterol levels to rise. Dietary fat helps with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K).
        Small amounts of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats may have some health benefits when they are part of a healthy diet.
        Monounsaturated fats are found in nuts, olive oil and avocados, and may help to lower the bad type of cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein or LDL).
        Polyunsaturated fats are generally thought to lower blood cholesterol levels. Polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, nuts and
        seeds, are thought to have an anti-clotting effect on blood, to reduce the risk of heart disease and to possibly lower blood pressure.</string>
